==ShellOS Quick Start==
This is a quick start guide for ShellOS 

==Setting up ShellOS==

You will need Python Installed alongside pip preferably 3.12.6 for python and pip 24.2 as ShellOS is built with these versions

Assuming you extracted the zip you are gonna want to run the main.py file by double clicking it or running "python main.py" 

If it does not start and closes you can run it using the before mentioned python main.py to see an error message 

If it doesn't start most likely these are some reasons it wont 

-Python isn't installed correctly

-Python's Scripts folder or Python in general isn't added to path you can have python install to path during Python Setup

-You dont meet the system requirements (you probably do as I don't think anyone has a pc with less than 192mb of ram, 25mb of storage and a 250mhz 1 core cpu)

-Pip is missing or not installed correctly

==Importing custom or 3rd party guis==
In ShellOS you can import other Graphical Shells besides the default ShellOS Shell

To do this you will need a Graphical Shell to actually import obviously and the folder must be named "Graphical_Shell"

Start by navigating to the "SYSTEM" folder and Selecting the already existing "Graphical_Shell" folder you can rename it to something else or delete it then drag or copy the new Graphical Shell into the folder it must be named "Graphical_Shell"
unless you're willing to modify the code of ShellOS

then run ShellOS to make sure it works and its done
